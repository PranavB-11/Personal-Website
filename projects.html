            <h2>FF Projections</h2>
            <p><em>Python, HTML, CSS</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a fantasy football projection algorithm for the 2023 season that considers over 40 stat-lines, external factors, and trends such as matchups and injuries to make a helpful projection for each player.</li>
                <li>Program utilizes 3 seasons of data and has web implementation where a user can enter a player and will receive an output of projections.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>World Generation</h2>
            <p><em>Java</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a pseudo-random world generation algorithm that builds a connected room-hallway map based on seeds that can be navigated by a user’s avatar and can be regenerated through saving and loading</li>
                <li>Program has encounter features that deploy a user into another world/frame for a particular purpose, timing for game use, and a NPC that chases the user following a path generated via BFS</li>
                <li>Saving and Loading is performed through one .txt file that saves the game in one string</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Wordnet</h2>
            <p><em>Java</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed an online Ngram viewer that displays a word(s)’ history lexically and graphically since 1400 constructed through extensions of TreeMap, handling approximately 500,000 words simultaneously given a user’s queries</li>
                <li>Implemented hyponym handler which unveils a word(s)’ hyponyms in a specific time frame depending on its historical popularity</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>E-Commerce Website</h2>
            <p><em>HTML, CSS, Javascript</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a modern e-commerce platform modeled after popular fashion and shopping websites</li>
                <li>Website supports mobile devices and allows users to add an item to cart, then proceed to a simulated checkout</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Chess AI</h2>
            <p><em>Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a Chess AI trained on an open-source move book that utilized DFS to sequence moves together against a human or simulated opponent.</li>
                <li>The winning-aspect of the AI was primarily trained on openers and searches for potential checkmates, while most of the gameplay experience was trained on repeated simulations</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="project-box">
            <h2>Pacman AI</h2>
            <p><em>Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow</em></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a Pacman AI that used an A* algorithm based on the following heuristics: Euclidean Distance, Manhattan Distance, "food", and corners to calculate paths.</li>
                <li>These distance heuristics were calculated using BFS and an "agent" that would search for an ideal path and send it back to Pacman to follow.</li>
